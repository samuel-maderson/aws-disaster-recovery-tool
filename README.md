## üìÅ Project Structure

A typical Go project structure might look like this. Adjust based on your actual layout:

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automated Failover and Failback:** Simplifies the process of switching operations to a recovery region and reverting to the primary region.
* **Support for Multiple AWS Regions:** Designed to work across different AWS regions for comprehensive disaster recovery strategies.
* **Easy to Configure and Use:** Aims for a straightforward setup and user experience.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

* **Go:** Version `1.x.x` or higher (Specify your project's Go version requirement, e.g., Go 1.18+). You can download it from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/).
* **AWS Account:** With appropriate IAM permissions for the AWS services this tool will manage (e.g., EC2, RDS, Route 53, S3).
* **AWS CLI (Recommended):** Configured with credentials and a default region. The Go SDK can also pick up credentials from environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`) or IAM roles for EC2 instances/ECS tasks.
* **Git:** For cloning the repository.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/samuel-maderson/aws-disaster-recovery-tool.git](https://github.com/samuel-maderson/aws-disaster-recovery-tool.git)
    cd aws-disaster-recovery-tool
    ```

2.  **Fetch dependencies:**
    If your project uses Go modules (it should have a `go.mod` file), dependencies will be downloaded automatically during the build or test process. You can also fetch them manually:
    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

3.  **Build the application:**
    (See [Building](#building) section for more details)
    ```bash
    go build -o recovery-tool ./cmd/recoverytool/main.go
    ```
    This will create an executable named `recovery-tool` (or your chosen name) in the current directory.

    Alternatively, to install it into your `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin`:
    ```bash
    go install ./cmd/recoverytool/...
    ```
    Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` is in your system's `PATH`.

*(TODO: Add any other specific installation steps if necessary, e.g., setting up environment variables required at install time.)*

---

## üîß Configuration

*(TODO: Detail how the application is configured. This could be via command-line flags, environment variables, or a configuration file (e.g., YAML, JSON, TOML).)*

**Example Configuration Methods:**

* **Configuration File:**
    * The tool might look for a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) in the current directory, user's home directory, or a path specified by a flag.
    * Provide a sample configuration file (`configs/config.example.yaml`) and explain its structure.
        ```yaml
        # configs/config.example.yaml
        primaryRegion: "us-east-1"
        secondaryRegion: "us-west-2"
        resources:
          ec2Instances:
            - "i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
          rdsInstances:
            - "mydbinstance"
        # Add other necessary parameters
        ```
* **Environment Variables:**
    * List the environment variables the tool recognizes (e.g., `AWS_PRIMARY_REGION`, `AWS_SECONDARY_REGION`, `APP_CONFIG_PATH`).
* **Command-line Flags:**
    * The application binary would accept flags to specify behavior or configuration overrides (e.g., `--primary-region`, `--config-file`).

**AWS Credentials:**
The AWS SDK for Go will automatically search for credentials in a specific order:
1.  Environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`).
2.  Shared credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`).
3.  Shared configuration file (`~/.aws/config`).
4.  IAM role for Amazon EC2 or ECS task role (if running on AWS infrastructure).

It's recommended to use IAM roles or the shared credentials file for better security rather than hardcoding credentials.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

*(TODO: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions and command-line examples for using the tool. This section is crucial for users.)*

Assuming the compiled binary is named `recovery-tool` and is in your PATH or current directory:

* **Show Help:**
    ```bash
    ./recovery-tool --help
    ```

* **Initiating Failover:**
    ```bash
    ./recovery-tool failover --config configs/my-dr-plan.yaml
    # OR using flags
    ./recovery-tool failover --primary-region us-east-1 --secondary-region us-west-2 --resource-tag "DRProtected:true"
    ```

* **Initiating Failback:**
    ```bash
    ./recovery-tool failback --config configs/my-dr-plan.yaml
    ```

* **Checking Status:**
    ```bash
    ./recovery-tool status --config configs/my-dr-plan.yaml
    ```

*(Adapt these examples to your tool's actual command-line interface, flags, and capabilities. Clearly explain what each command does and any expected output or side effects.)*

---

## üîó Dependencies

* **Go Modules:** This project uses Go modules for dependency management. The main dependencies are listed in the `go.mod` file.
* **AWS SDK for Go:** (`github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go` or `github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2`) - For interacting with AWS services.
* *(List any other key Go packages or external libraries used by the project.)*

To see all dependencies, refer to the `go.mod` file.

---

## üß™ How to Run Tests

*(TODO: Provide instructions on how to run the tests for your Go application.)*

1.  **Navigate to the project's root directory.**
2.  **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    go test ./...
    ```
3.  **Run tests for a specific package:**
    ```bash
    go test ./internal/core/
    ```
4.  **Run tests with verbosity:**
    ```bash
    go test -v ./...
    ```
5.  **Run tests with coverage:**
    ```bash
    go test -cover ./...
    # To generate an HTML coverage report:
    go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
    go tool cover -html=coverage.out
    ```

*(Ensure you have test files (e.g., `*_test.go`) in your project.)*

---

## üèóÔ∏è Building

To build the executable from source:

1.  **Navigate to the project's root directory.**
2.  **Build for your current OS/architecture:**
    If your main package is in `cmd/recoverytool/main.go`:
    ```bash
    go build -o recovery-tool ./cmd/recoverytool/main.go
    ```
    This will create an executable named `recovery-tool` in the project root.

3.  **Cross-compilation (Optional):**
    To build for a different OS/architecture (e.g., Linux from macOS):
    ```bash
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o recovery-tool-linux-amd64 ./cmd/recoverytool/main.go
    ```
    Replace `linux` and `amd64` with the target OS and architecture.

*(TODO: Specify any build tags or linker flags if used.)*

---

## üöÄ Deployment

*(TODO: Describe how to deploy or distribute the tool. For a Go CLI tool, this usually means distributing the compiled binary.)*

* **Binary Distribution:** Users can download the pre-compiled binary for their OS/architecture from a GitHub Releases page (if you create one) or build it from source.
* **Containerization (Optional):** If applicable, provide instructions on how to build and run the tool using Docker. Include a `Dockerfile`.
    ```dockerfile
    # Example Dockerfile
    FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY go.mod go.sum ./
    RUN go mod download
    COPY . .
    RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-w -s" -o /recovery-tool ./cmd/recoverytool/main.go

    FROM alpine:latest
    COPY --from=builder /recovery-tool /usr/local/bin/recovery-tool
    # Add any necessary CA certificates or configurations
    # RUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates

    ENTRYPOINT ["recovery-tool"]
    CMD ["--help"]
    ```
* **Package Managers (Optional):** If you plan to distribute via Homebrew, Scoop, or other package managers, outline the steps here or link to relevant resources.
